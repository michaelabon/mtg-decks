## Removal

* Beast Within - Should be in every deck that can run it. Very versatile,
    instant speed and unconditional. It basically never lets you down.
* Putrefy - One of the best creature removals, and can also get artifacts.
    Also unconditional which is very nice.
* Barrin's Spite - Amazing tech, really. Gets rid of two creatures basically,
    and can even get rid of eldrazis (Ulamog in particular). Sad thing
    though is that your enemy needs at least two creatures for this two
    work. But it worked great for me so far.
* Damnation - Every deck needs wrath effects, and this is the cheapest for
    this color combination.
* Decree of Pain - Kill all creatures and draw tons of cards? Yes please!
* Dregs of Sorrow - I recently added this, and haven't gotten to play it yet,
    but the raw card advantage it can provide is just awesome.
* Life's Finale - Another good wrath, rats can still be regenerated with
    Swarmyard, and against some decks it can really thin them out on creatures.
    The second effect is optional, so if your enemy runs heavy recursion,
    you don't have to.
* Consuming Vapors - It removes two creatures, bypasses
    shroud/hexproof/indestructible, gives you life and is easily splashable.

I might want to add All is Dust if I find something to take out of the deck for it.

## Ramp

After the recent changes, this section is almost gone.

* Reap and Sow/Expedition Map - These are more like tutors than ramp
    (especially map). With so many nonbasics though, they are more
    powerful and can even tutor up that [graveyard hate][hate] or
    [other][] [utility][].
* Gilded Lotus - Gives you big mana, can tap the turn it comes into
    play and can also fill mana lacks if you need blue or green. You can
    play a rat right after it enters.

## Boosters/Multipliers

Some of these cards only work on rats in edh, and that makes them
even more flavorful to me. This section includes all cards which
copy rats, let you search for rats, or boost them up in any way.

* Concordant Crossroads - This should have been in the first version
    already. Haste is just too good with rats.
* Akroma's Memorial - The only good way to give them haste, and a
    really fun and great card anyway. Draws a lot of removal though.
* Thrumming Stone - A great win condition for rats. Usually rat decks
    are made to tutor this thing up, but that's not our strategy, we
    don't want every game to play out the same way. Rats decrease
    variation enough by themselves. But obviously it's powerful enough
    for us to run it.
* Ratcatcher - He gets us a rat every turn. Great card advantage,
    and a quite nice body along with that.
* Bloodbond March - Insane with rats. Makes you very resilient to
    wraths, which is exactly what this deck needs.
* Doubling Chant - Crazy funny card in this deck, but really just
    a "win more" card. But it has to be included for flavor reasons
    alone.
* Pack Hunt - Gets you three rats for {3}{G}. Quite good, like drawing
    three cards you definitely need.
* Rite of Replication - Hilarious with rats, 5 rats for 9? Pretty
    good deal.

## Recursion

This section got a bit extended now, and I think I am happy with
that. Graveyard cards are always easily accessible, and unless you
permanently abuse it, people won't direct graveyard hate in your
direction either.

* Aphetto Dredging - Gets you three rats back. The condition is very
    easily met in this deck.
* Patriarch's Bidding - I don't see many people going tribal recently,
    so this is a pretty safe thing. It lets you recover from wraths or
    just pull surprise wins with any haste enabler.
* Living Death - This thing always makes the battlefield a party.
    Everyone is happy and throwing around creatures. It can also screw
    greatly with people who think they have a big board position, and
    deals mercilessly with all kinds of eldrazi and similar aswell.

You might consider Bloodbond March recursion aswell, but w/e.

## Card Draw

Early in the game, one or two rats a turn might be enough, but late
game that isn't only not enough, but we also need big card draw to
keep that up. So I put a lot of card draw in different colors in
here. Consider that I don't like to use cards which cost more than
one of green and blue because this deck is basically 80% black.
There are a few exceptions.


* Necrologia - You basically draw your hand back to full, or more. It
    can cost quite some life and is slow, but it being an instant is
    harder to deal with than the enchantments, and it's also still
    faster than they are.
* Recurring Insight - This should draw you many cards, more than a
    Mind Unbound will ever do.
* Desperate Research - A draw spell that only works in a rats deck. In
    return, the mana cost is very cheap though.
* Phyrexian Arena - A pretty well known card for great card drawing.
    The cost is negligible, because the benefits are just too good. It
    also kind of falls under the radar a lot aswell.
* Ambition's Cost - Good draw, and very splashable, and unconditional.
* Biomantic Mastery - Very conditional card, but it usually draws you
    really really big amounts of cards. Best when you have Reliquary
    Tower on the field.
* Night's Whisper - Very cheap mana cost and always worth it. It
    doesn't even cost two black like its brother Sign in Blood, and
    can't be redirected either.
* Promise of Power - Drawing 5 cards for  is really great, and
    lategame if you are swimming in mana, it can provide you a nice
    flying beater aswell.
* Syphon Mind - Usually draws about 3 cards, which is already enough
    reason to run it. The discard makes it even better.
* Tezzeret's Gambit - Phyrexian mana is easy to pay in EDH/Commander,
    and outside from that it's just nice drawing. The proliferate can be
    used both politically aswell as on a few lands, Mind Unbound or your
    Mimeoplasm.

I didn't include Ancient Craving because it's the same as Ambition's
Cost, but costs more $$$ and is uglier (I don't really like portal
cards).

## Lands

Unfortunately I can't afford expensive Ravnica or Beta Duals, and
even Filterlands seem kind of expensive, especially since I believe
they wouldn't dramatically alter the flow of the deck. So now onto
the lands I can afford and have included:


* Barren Moor - It gives you , which is what you need most of the
    time. And compared to swamps, it's not a completely terrible topdeck
    lategame. Everyone knows cycling is good.
* Bojuka Bog - Oh yes, really powerful graveyard hate in a land spot?
    Basically uncounterable and it even provides black mana? What's not
    to like.
* Command Tower - Everyone's favourite commander land. No need to
    explain.
* Crypt of Agadeem - A little bit of Cabal Coffers style, this thing
    is capable of producing insane amounts of mana. But it also taps for
    B in the worst case and somewhat falls under the radar compared to
    coffers, which everyone notices and freaks out about right away.
* Terramorphic Expanse /Evolving Wilds - Better colorfixing than
    bouncelands and don't feel as terrible.
* Drowned Catacomb - A bit more expensive for being a land, but this
    thing is awesome. It's almost as good as real duals.
* Exotic Orchard - In big multiplayer games, this usually taps for
    whatever you need. I like it.
* Forest/ Island /Swamp - Derp.
* Gilt-Leaf Palace - We don't run elves, but this is acceptable
    anyway. Sometimes we just need that green mana.
* Jwar Isle Refuge - It enters tapped, but we can live with that. The
    one life isn't really a big deal, but it can provide blue mana when
    we need it.
* Reliquary Tower - After casting a Biomantic Mastery or something
    similar, this can really help a lot.
* Rupture Spire - Haters gonna hate, but I like it, and it's really
    cheap aswell.
* Salt Marsh - Like Jwar Isle Refuge.
* Shimmering Grotto - Can provide green or blue mana in clutch
    situations, and colorless in others. Acceptable, not too fond of it
    but w/e. We take what we can get.
* Swarmyard - It regenerates RATS. Pretty much ALL of our creatures,
    even the commander! Best land you could ever get for this deck.
* Tainted Isle - Condition is easily met, and the gain is awesome. I
    wish there was more like this.
* Tainted Wood - And luckily there is one more.
* Vivid Marsh - Provides , and other colors for a few times.
    Tezzeret's Gambit can also proliferate this one, but that hardly
    matters. ETB tapped is fine with us.
* Woodland Cemetery - It also almost always enters untapped, and
    provides what we need. Awesome. Also dat flavor text.

## Considered / Wanted Cards


* All is Dust - Very good board wipe, and also gets rid of
    enchantments and colored artifacts. Not sure if it is better than
    Life's Finale, as it leaves eldrazis and artifact creatures alive.
    Plus this deck doesn't run many artifacts, so the symmetry is
    usually in enemy's favor.
* Oversold Cemetery - This just came to my mind, and I wonder why I
    didn't consider it before. I can imagine it being wonderful in this
    deck.
* Pernicious Deed - I left this out partly for budget reasons aswell.
    It's a good card, but chances are, no matter what you want to blow
    up, your rats die aswell. It also costs a lot of mana and is
    terrible at blowing up really big cards.
* Cover of Darkness - While one of the few good ways of giving your
    rats evasion, I think this is a little win-more. I had this in and
    it did farily well the few times I had it, so I might consider it
    again if someone wants to convince me.
* Steely Resolve - I had this in the deck, and took it out pretty fast
    again. While it might sound good, I found that rats are never target
    of spot removal, and it renders cards like Pack Hunt obsolete. It
    never did anything good for me.
* Gigantomancer - A very unusual card, but it can make rats really
    powerful. Lategame you probably have more mana than you can spend
    anyway, and this makes rats into big fat rats + their mass bonus.
    Even with just one or two rats out, they can become reasonably huge.
    And it's such a funny card that people will just be like WTF,
    because at least for me, I've never seen someone play this.
* Grave Pact - There are so many rats dying in this deck, and this
    would keep the field clean. Enemies would also think more than twice
    about blocking rats.
* Temporal Aperture - I re-discovered this card for me, and I love it.
    Like drawing cards, just better. Though there are some cards that
    you don't always want to play right away, I find they are rather
    few, so I think this could be great here.
* Larceny - A tool made for aggro decks which disrupts other players.
    I think this should be included, although the mana cost is somewhat
    high.
* Coastal Piracy - This draws an insane amount of cards over time, but
    the {U}{U} is a bit difficult.
