mtg-decks
=========

Repo and changelog of my decks in Magic: the Gathering.

Each deck will be in its own directory so that I can have
an appropriate (and pretty) page that explains it.

I highly recommend an extension in your browser that gives card names an
overlay, such as AutocardAnywhere in [Firefox][acaw-fx] or [Chrome][acaw-gc].

Feel free to [ask me a question][new-issue].
